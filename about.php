                    <p class="about__process_text">
                        Aeternum Capital applies a private equity mindset to identify underperforming and overlooked quality companies with significant value creation potential. The investment process starts with a thorough screening of the addressable investment universe, to identify opportunities for further in-depth analysis of individual companies and markets. This is followed by industry expert discussions, advisory board input and final discussions and decision by the investment team. After a decision to move forward has been made, Aeternum establishes a dialogue with the company management and board.

                    Aeternum Capital applies well-defined investment criteria framework to ensure focus on high quality companies with significant value creation potential. The companies we seek are often industry leaders in consumer, healthcare, tech/software/gaming and industrial niches, with strong tailwinds from important societal megatrends. In addition, the companies must have strong company culture, attractive business models with high, recurring quality revenue, and preferably be a niche-leader with pricing power in the market.
